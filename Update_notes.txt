***Planning/Controls***
Fixed bugs causing the pose topic to not be selected and resort to the first available topic.
Split the pose type and pose topic selection functions that were causing the selection issues.
For instance if pose topic was selected prior to topic type then it was fine, the other way round wont change the topic as per later selection.
Tested the codebase and GUI for static onroad and static + adaptive offroad models
